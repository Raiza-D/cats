/* As per mentor Pedro's advice: Declare and validate ALWAYS.
Refer to LInes 9 to 12. Declare a variable that contains the value
you're looking for. Then if that value cannot be found anywhere within
the object, return a message. This avoids having an UNDEFINED being returned.
Having undefined returned is not specific at all.
The declare and validate approach means you take care of scenarios
where a value being passed in cannot be found. */
